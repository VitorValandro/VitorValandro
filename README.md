### ðŸ’¡ Hi there!

I'm a web developer graduated at Instituto Federal Catarinense (IFC), in Brazil. Currently I'm studying **algorithms, data structures and performance optimization in web applications**. 

My hard skills range from Data Science, Machine Learning and Web Scrapping (acquired when I was a cybersecurity researcher working on DDoS attacks) to robotics with arduino, Game Development, RESTFul APIs, reactive Single Page Applications and design. 

My **main stack** is composed of:

And also Python3 to automation of boring stuff or applied data science (data capturing, cleaning, processing and extracting info).

I'm also looking for **opportunities as a Junior Web Developer**, so if you want to know more about me, let's connect and talk!
